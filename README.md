# Explanation:
<ol>
<li>HTML Structure:</li>
</ol>
The code starts with the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, indicating that it's an HTML5 document.
The <html> tag represents the root of the HTML document.
The <head> section contains meta-information about the document and links to external resources.
The <body> tag contains the visible content of the webpage.
CSS Reset:

The CSS code at the beginning (* { margin: 0; padding: 0; box-sizing: border-box; }) is a CSS reset, ensuring consistent styling across different browsers by resetting margins, paddings, and box-sizing.
Navigation Bar:

The navigation bar is defined inside a <div class="navbar">.
The navigation bar has multiple navigation items (<div class="nav">), including "Home," "Services," "About," "Project," and "Contact."
The "Home" navigation item has a specific class (<div class="nav home">) and a white background with black text.
Upper Section:

The upper section contains an empty <div class="upper">, which serves as a placeholder.
The background image of the upper section is set using CSS (background-image property).
Mid Section:

The mid section is defined inside a <div class="mid">.
It contains three images (<img>) displayed side by side with specific dimensions.
Lower Section:

The lower section is defined inside a <div class="lower">.
The lower section has a black background color and a background image set using CSS.
It contains two elements side by side: a paragraph (<p class="lower_left">) and an image (<img class="lower_right">).
CSS Styling:

Various CSS styles are applied to elements, defining their appearance.
The navigation bar has a gradient background, and each navigation item is displayed inline-block with specific margin and color.
The "Home" navigation item has a white background with black text.
The mid section images have specific margins, widths, and heights to be displayed uniformly.
Responsive Design:

The use of the viewport meta tag in the <head> ensures proper scaling for different screen sizes.
External Stylesheet:

The HTML file links to an external stylesheet (style.css) to apply the defined styles.
